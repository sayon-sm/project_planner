# Simple To-do App

###### This application has two main components: ACTIVE PROJECTS and FINISHED PROJECTS. Both components hold multiple projects/tasks to be managed.

###### Each project has a TITLE, DESCRIPTION, and two BUTTONS.

###### The first button opens an alert that displays a message based on the task.

###### The second button is used to move the task from ACTIVE to FINISHED, and vice versa.

## This is my practice project to learn:

- DOM Manipulation
- Event Handling
- Event Listeners
- Callback Functions
- Class-Based Structure
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Constructor Functions
- Method Definition
- Function Expressions
- Arrow Functions (if used elsewhere)
- Dynamic UI Updates
- State Management
- Conditional Logic
- Data Attributes
- Element Selection (querySelector, getElementById)
- Parent-Child Node Relationships
- Element Appending (appendChild)
- Text Content Manipulation
- Removing and Adding Event Listeners
- Alert Dialogs
- Console Logging (Debugging)
- Code Organization
- Separation of Concerns
